# react-comments
This is my custom implementation of  the official React tutorial found in [this link](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)

It's based on my [react-starter](https://github.com/daigof/react-starter) project, which means it uses node, pre-compilation of JSX and webpack. I also replaced browser-sync with node-express.
